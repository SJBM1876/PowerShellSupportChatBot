# PowerShellSupportChatBot
I work in team that use Powershell to monitor, update and fix any issues with M365 Communications. I would like to create  a chatbot that could help team members with powershell problems and solutions. 

// The following is the intial plan for a Powershell Support Chatbot. The project is likely to evolve and deviate from the original idea. I will use issues to keep on track; creating new issues if there is a change to the plan.

The chatbot will:

Initially run in the command line interface.
Respond to PowerShell queries: Provide solutions, examples, or explanations for PowerShell commands.
Help with troubleshooting: Assist in resolving issues with M365 communications by suggesting relevant PowerShell commands or scripts.
Integration with GitHub: Push updates, store frequently used PowerShell scripts, and track issues.
Scalability: Allow future enhancements, such as integration with databases, APIs, or other tools.

Tech Stack
Java: Primary programming language for the chatbot.
IntelliJ IDEA: Integrated Development Environment (IDE) for writing and managing Java code.
GitHub: Version control for code collaboration and management.
PowerShell: The scripting language the chatbot will be helping with.

Libraries/Frameworks:
JDA (Java Discord API) or Telegram API: to deploy the chatbot on messaging platforms (further development).
Spring Boot: For creating a standalone application with REST APIs if needed(further development).
Java SDK: For running PowerShell commands from Java.
JUnit: For testing.
